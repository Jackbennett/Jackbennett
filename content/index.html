  <h2>Completed Projects</h2>
  <p>In the future I will call out to some presentable accomplishments but until then have a look through my <a href="https://github.com/JackBennett">Github profile</a> for my work.</p>
  <h3><a href="https://github.com/Jackbennett/project-discovery#readme" title="Discover running websites on a network" target="_blank">Discovery</a></h3>
  <p>This is a server I wrote that shows website projects being worked on within a network. It's for use in a classroom situation to make a lesson more interactive. The idea being if students can quickly see how their class mates are getting on they might focus more to show off their own work.</p>

  <h1 id="Experience">Experience</h1>
  <p>I've spent a decade with computers and I'm only finding more to learn. Being able to make a machine do work for you that was previously a chore gives a great sense of accomplishment.</p>
  <h2>Development</h2>
  <p>I've been told an interesting thing about the lathe, a solid piece of equipment you use for working wood or metals. It's the only tool that has the ability to make itself. Which means only the operators ability to think through a job will stand in the way. Now that's all very Zen but it encompasses the philosophy I try to keep with computers. As I'm entirely self-taught, once you've got a computer you have that same ability to solve almost any problem. Especially when you realise to make the next tool with the last tool and keep stepping closer. With the added bonus of it not being 3 tonnes of cast iron and a room full of stock.</p>
  <h3>HTML 5</h3>
  <p>The web got me into programming, I didn't learn anything until I sat down with an empty notepad.exe, a whole lot of reading tutorials and documentation. Eventually that progressed to a little PHP for templates which got me into the wider world of servers, hosting and DNS. This would be where my work life started and I found it a useful crossing of skill set and interests.</p>
  <h3>JavaScript</h3>
  <p>Naturally from html5 comes JS, around the NodeJS 0.4 release and saw the value in investing time to a language running both the client and the server. Starting from such a basic level really built an understanding of the client/server interaction the web uses. How HTTP passes data from the browser through your application to the database.</p>
  <h3>PowerShell</h3>
  <p>PowerShell has a wonderful ability to quickly write something to get a job done, yet add to it and tidy your work each time you come back to the same task. Eventually it ends up as something sharable across a whole host of tasks. Especially once you embrace the composable nature of the language. The tight integration of the help system is such a leap forward in clarity when learning the language.</p>
  <h3>Python</h3>
  <p>This is a recent addition to my repertoire and it's been a little harder than I'd like to admit in unlearning some JS habits, as I've only made trivial things in it there's not much to say yet but I'm looking forward to more.</p>

  <h2>Computer Systems</h2>
  <p>Learning about the web is a gateway to so many things, starting with my own server running from a provider, getting SSH configured, set up Apache web hosting, mysql databases onto distributed services</p>

      <h3 class="col">Windows</h3>

    <div class="column three">
      <div class="col">
        <p>There's a lot of polish on Window that's hard to ignore, it makes for a very pleasant desktop experience.</p>
        <p>Using Windows since 2000 was the new hot thing. <small>(Rebooting '98 into DOS to play Command &amp; Conquer doesn't count)</small> Now coming to deploy 10 and 2016 much has changed and it's more interesting than ever.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col" style="text-align: center;">
        <p>When it comes to servers that polish starts to hinder, managing details the way windows hides behind wizards and the registry can make it frustrating.</p>
        <p>With linux and everything being in a text file somewhere it's a lot more accessible to learn about. I get to use docker on my windows 10 laptop to provision development configurations </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col" style="text-align: right;">
        <p>With linux I stick to Fedora to get a nice mix of recent packages easily available and steady support.</p>
        <p>CoreOS is something I'm starting to experiment with as the update module is very attractive coupled with stacking docker on top to separate the host OS from the application. With a view to making development easier</p>

  <h3>Embedded</h3>
  <p>Arduino but more recently Espurino running on both the pico board and BBC micro:bit has been an enjoyable way to pick up some electronics skills. It's always nice to think "I could make that" then to actually do it, from Bluetooth pressure sensors to wall mounted boards for interactive art displays.</p>

  <h1 id="Education">Education</h1>
  <p>There's always something to learn so I'm constantly looking out for interesting things to pick up, formally however I jumped at the chance to get on with learning on the job.</p>

      <h2>BTEC National Diploma</h2>
      <p>The IT Practitioners National Diploma was 18 modules of various subject areas within computing, from media, business to programming. The variety kept things interesting.</p>

      <h2>A Level Computing</h2>
      <p>Completed my A-level during the BTEC course, I was lucky to get a timetable that fit these two. Computing is memories of SQL and hand written assembly, neither where very enjoyable.</p>
