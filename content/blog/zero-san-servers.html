title: Zero SAN Servers

<h1>Zero SAN Servers</h1>
<h2>Deploying redundant shared services on the cheap without a SAN</h2>
<p>This post aims to detail a method used to provide services to users/clients that are not interrupted by something as trivial as server reboots or power outages.
    Before we go into too much detail this is a sea of product names and industry names used as product names.
    It's worth always reminding yourself of the gaol we're even after?</p>
<!--remember the goal-->
<blockquote>Remember The Goal: No Downtime</blockquote>
<p>In this example I'm going to try to explain the solid underpinnings of a basic but functional network that you could go into the server rack and pull the power from a single host yet nobody would notice.
    I would define a basic network ans something that provides the following services;
</p>
<ol>
    <li>DHCP - For connectivity</li>
    <li>DNS - For finding connectivity</li>
    <li>Active Directory - For multiple user access</li>
    <li>Shared Storage - For data that users want to save and share.</li>
</ol>
