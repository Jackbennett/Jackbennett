<h1>Forging a site with metalsmith</h1>
<h2><small>See what I did there.</small></h2>

<p>There not much to static site generators but getting from their product description and 1 page example to your own site can sometimes feel more frustrating that it should.
    This post will show you each component you'll want to add to metalsmith to end up with a site that works in a way we're happy with.
    With that in mind I should probably get into what happy looks like</p>

<p>
    <ol>
        <li>Template the site separately from content</li>
        <li>Create a site with nice urls (no file extensions)</li>
        <li>Silo content and assets per post to make maintanece easier</li>
        <li>Minimal extra framework like metadata to organize content</li>
    </ol>
    To get metalsmith to meet the above we'll need a number of plugins from the community but it seems quite promising.
    Next then we'll dive into a working metalsmith setup, explain how that's working then add piece by piece modules to meet the above requirements
</p>
